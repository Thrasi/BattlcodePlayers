basic strategy: Rally troops 1/4 distance to enemy HQ until turn 1600 then attack.

Miners: move at random until they can mine.  This needs to be better.

Soldiers: attack anything within range or move to rally point. TODO: They should attack nearby enemies if they are attacking friends.

Beavers: build a minerfactory, build 3 barracks, build a tank factory, mine.

Tanks: same as soldiers.

Bashers: move to rallypoint.

HQ: counts units.

All robots that spawn new robots do so until the following numbers are reached:
20 Miners, Soldiers, Bashers, Tanks
3 Beavers
